# sn_chrome_extension
Improving a very specific Service Now instance for work.  

To install this extension do the following.

1. Open Chrome, browse to chrome://extensions in the omnibox
2. Enable Developer mode in top right
3. Click, 'Load unpacked'
4. Browse to the folder where all the files exist
5. Select Folder 
6. Click puzzle (extensions) button in top right of Chrome
7. Pin the extension

Some notes:
- This is very specific to an instance of Service now, not sure if the other instances will use different class names for the CSS elements
- The height is in pixels, not lines, could do some math, but I prefer pixels as its directly relates to the underlying code
- The extension probably could use some edgecase testing, and certainly a better looking interface
